- remove NA or fill with 0
- check for class imbalance (http://machinelearningmastery.com/tactics-to-combat-imbalanced-classes-in-your-machine-learning-dataset/)
- 70(cv)/20(dev)/10(test)
- discretising features (some models dont perform well on floats)
- feature selection (subset selection: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html#sklearn.metrics.make_scorer)
- Interquartile range filter (identify all the instances which are likely to be outliers)
- Build model (how to select the best classification algorithm)
- Error analysis (confusion matrix, figure out what might be wrong)
- Cost sensitive analysis (log loss) Justify why this delivers business value.
